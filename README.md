HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the foundation and framework of a webpage by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, buttons, and forms. HTML focuses on what appears on a page, organizing the information into meaningful sections. Think of it as the skeleton of a website.
